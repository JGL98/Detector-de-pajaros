Common Teal 2

On 15 March 2022, Erika and I found another of the European race of the Green-winged Teal. It foraged in almost exactly the same location at the bird we saw several weeks ago at the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge, on 1 March 2022. This duck lacks the white, vertical side-stripe of American Green-winged Teal but does not appear to be the same individual that previously observed. The pale facial lines do not seem to be as distinct. Also, the horizontal, white body stripe is more apparent.
